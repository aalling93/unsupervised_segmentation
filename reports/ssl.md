# Self supervisesd learning

learn equally good features without supervision...
- learn the representation of everything. 
- then ony have few classes we post train on.
- better generalisation where the model learns much more about the world.
- 



Reconstruct from a corruted version:
-predict VH from VV
- predict VV/VH from masked version
- predict Speckle free from VV/VH , ....

Denoising Autoenvoder:
- Take image, add noise, get original iamge..
- Noise:
    Additive Isotropic Gaussian Nosie
    Masking Noise 
    Salt and pepper noise. 

Stacked Denoisning Autoenvoder.


ide:
Make aNN to take SAR, remomove nouse etc, and use that as input for the mode.
